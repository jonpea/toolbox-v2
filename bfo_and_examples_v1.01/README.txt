%  DOCUMENTATION:
----------------------------------------

An extensive description of the use of BFO is given in the header of the
Matlab file ./bfo.m and in the published html page ./bfo_html_pdf/bfo.html.

A copy of the referring manuscript "NTR-06-2015.pdf" is provided in ./bfo_html_pdf/.

% CONTENTS OF THE "BFO-CODE" DIRECTORY:
----------------------------------------

- The solver bfo.m

- Driver test programs: 
  1) test_bfo.m
  2) test_cutest.m
  3) test_equilibrium.m
  4) test_paper_examples.m
  5) test_rcubic_training.m 
  6) test_vbeam_training.m  

- Directory "test_problems" containing the test problems:
  1) the fruity set *.m files and corresponding *_data.m files: orange, kiwi,
     banana, apple, fruit_bowl, etc
  2) the CUTEst problems .SIF files used in the paper located in ./cutest_problems/
  3) the equilibrium problem files: demand.m, benefit.m, satisfaction.m, budget.m

  VBEAM and RCUBIC test problems are generated and (possibly) saved in 
  ./test_problems/vbeam_problems/ and ./test_problems/rcubic_problems/,
  running test_vbeam_training.m and test_rcubic_training.m, respectively.

- Directory "auxiliary_functions" containing:
  1) test_bfo_check.m
  2) compute_performance_history.m
  3) cutest_pblist.m
  5) lcurve.m

- Directory "bfo_html" containing pictures and bfo.html with the published version of 
  bfo.m generated with MATLABÂ® 7.14

Descriptions of the above .m programs are included at the beginning of each file.
  
% RUNNING TESTS:
----------------------------------------

- Test problems described in the papers can be obtained running the script test_*.m.
  ES:
     >> test_paper_examples
  or
     >> test_vbeam_training

- The output files of all drivers are saved in corresponding directories 
  named ./test_*_output/

- The driver test_bfo.m tests the main program checking many of the possible user argument 
  list combinations.

- Warning: it is possible to run test_cutest.m only if a CUTEst Matlab interface is currently installed.

% DEVELOPMENT HISTORY
----------------------------------------

Version 1.01:
  inclusion of a user-defined search step
  correction of a bug affecting the name of an objective function  after restart
