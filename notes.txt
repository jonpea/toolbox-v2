TODO
====
- Decompose tracescene.m and provide a detailed supporting document.

Key Modules to Document
=======================
- Antenna patterns: isofunction, sphericalpattern
- Both work (deliberately) in cartesian coordinates native to tracescene
- I/O: loadcolumns, scanheader, ungrid

Key concepts
============
- The ultimate input to user-defined gain propagation functions is a 
  an unstructured set of direction vectors in local Cartesian coordinates; 
- 

Demos
=====
* Extruding plans & transforming scenes
- Reading Butterworth data
- Generalised fractional programming

Utilities
=========
Geometry
- Slicing a grid e.g. vertically
- Partitioning a plan by room
- 3D interactive capabilities

Testing
=======
* Enumeration of facet combinations 

Profiling
=========
- Calculation of transmission points with Embree

Geometry
========
* Slicing a grid e.g. vertically
* Partitioning a plan by room

Repositories
============
- nellib Fortran code with makefile

Recurring patterns
==================
- disp(struct2table(someStruct))
