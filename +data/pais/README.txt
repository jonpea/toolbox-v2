The data in this folder was recorded on Level 7 and Level 8 of the engineering tower using
the Labview software package.  It records the path loss from 14 transmitters at various 
locations on these two floors.  The locations of the transmitters and of the measurement points
are shown in the diagrams stored in the 'maps/measurement locations' folder.  The co-ordinates of the measurement
points are recorded in an excel file in the same folder.  This contains an explaination of
the co-ordinate system.

Note that the file numbering system used is 'floornumber_pointnumber.xls'. e.g. The data at 
measurement point 32 on floor number 7 would be in '7_32.xls'.
